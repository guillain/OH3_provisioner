## What to do after?

Only the web pages must be created manually.

### OpenHab UI
Copy/paste the content of the file generated in `OpenHAB/generate` to populate the source code.

### HABPanel
Create one `template` by floor and upload the page content from the files from the folder `OpenHAB/HABPanel/*.html`.
